Ball Shuffle Game

A simple Python-based guessing game where players try to find the ball hidden under one of three shuffled cups. This interactive program demonstrates basic Python programming concepts such as list manipulation, randomization, and user input validation.
How It Works

    A list (blist) contains three positions, with one ball ("O") randomly placed in one of them.
    The list is shuffled to hide the ball.
    The player guesses the position of the ball by selecting a number: 0, 1, or 2.
    The program checks the player's guess and reveals the correct position of the ball.

Features

    Randomized ball position using Python's random.shuffle.
    Input validation to ensure valid guesses.
    Immediate feedback on whether the player guessed correctly.
    Final reveal of the ball's position.

Requirements

    Python 3.x
    No additional dependencies.

Customization

    Adjust the blist for a different setup.
    Enhance the game with more advanced features, such as:
        Multiple rounds with a score tracker.
        A graphical user interface (GUI).
        A difficulty mode with more positions.
